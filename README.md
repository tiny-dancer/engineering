# Engineering Expectations

## Roles and Primary Responsibilities

> Primary goal is delivering value to the users and thus the business.

### Mid Level Engineer

- Capable of delivering features/capabilities self sufficiently in a timely manner most of the time.
- Ready to take ownership and delve into new technology areas with a quick ramp up.
- Not expected to lead innovation efforts, but is actively particiapting
- Well versed in at least single area of development stack (ui, api, database, etc) and aware of majority of components in play
- Team player

### Sr Engineer (A codebase leader)

- Capable of delivering features/capabilities self sufficiently in a timely manner.
- Nurtures and leads the code base vs fighting it
  - Developing maintainable, tested, clean code
  - A design pattern is clearly present and code is not “brute forced” in
- Being inclusive of team members
- Ability to ramp up quickly around new technology areas, take ownership and deliver
- Well versed in several areas of development stack (ui, api, database, etc) and aware of majority of components in play

### Lead Engineer (Scrum team engineering leader)

- Extends Sr Engineer to include more leadership at a scrum team level vs a code level
  - A key technical representative and decision maker in product prioritization, planning conversations
  - A technical leader for the team in architectural direction and conversations
  - A leader in technical design and implementation for sprint work
  - Providing support and mentorship for engineering team members
   - Enabling team members to step out of their comfort zone and efficiently learn new areas
- Understanding and ideally fluent in end to end delivery of a software product (database, backend, frontend, ci, cd, the edge, automation, etc)
- Well versed in all areas of development stack (ui, api, database, etc) and aware of all components in play
- Identify opportunities to optimize and solidify current delivery process which could mean introducing new quality check processes, introducing new tool/technology etc

> Any Engineer absolutely can participate in these same conversations, the difference is the lead engineer is viewed as a key decision maker in these matters.

### Engineering Manager (A product(s) engineering leader)

- Extends lead engineer responsibilities across one or more teams
- Responsible for product quality and delivery
- Removes blockers deriving from external teams
- Sets and leads the high level goals of architectural direction
    - In collaboration with appropriate parties, ie. organization goals, architects, directors, peers, scrum teams, etc
- Works closely with product and business on direction and prioritization of product
- Defines and ensures high quality team tooling, engineering practices and processes

> Any Engineer absolutely can participate and provide feedback in these same conversations, the difference is the lead engineers are viewed as key decision makers and engineering manager is viewed as the decision maker in these matters. A lead engineer should be able to strongly represent their respective scrum team. An engineering manager may likely defer to a lead engineer.
